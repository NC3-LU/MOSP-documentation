== Introduction

This document is intended to be a presentation and a user guide to
link:https://github.com/CASES-LU/MOSP[MOSP], a platform to create, edit and share valid JSON objects.

MOSP supports any kind of JSON objects, you just have to specify a <<JSON schema>>.
The instance link:https://objects.monarc.lu[objects.monarc.lu] is operated by link:https://www.cases.lu[CASES].
It is dedicated to gather security related objects, in the first place aimed to be used with link:https://www.monarc.lu[MONARC].

Objects officially provided by the MONARC project are available link:https://objects.monarc.lu/organization/MONARC[here].
Note that any *object* created with a *JSON schema* provided by the MONARC project will be compatible with the MONARC software.
In other words, you can use our JSON schemas in order to create objects (standards, mapping, etc.) for a usage in your own security analysis.


== Objects involved in MOSP

The core concept of MOSP lies on the <<JSON schema,JSON schemas>> and <<Objects,JSON Objects>>.
Each objects you create within MOSP will conform to a selected schema.

=== JSON schema

A JSON schema describes and validates your existing data format(s).
This ensures the quality of client submitted data.
MOSP also uses JSON schemas for the generation of the object editor.

For example, the JSON schema available link:https://objects.monarc.lu/schema/view/12[here]
validates the security standards used in MONARC.


==== Example of schemas

- link:https://objects.monarc.lu/schema/12[Security standards]
- link:https://objects.monarc.lu/schema/13[Security standards mapping]


=== Objects

==== Example of objects

- link:https://objects.monarc.lu/object/view/5139[Internet of Things - IoT [EN]]
- link:https://objects.monarc.lu/object/98ca84fb-db87-11e8-ac77-0800279aaa2b[ISO/IEC 27002]



== Using the platform

=== Creating a new object

When creating a new object with MOSP you have to:

- choose a JSON schema from the ones available on the platform;
- specify a name and a brief description;
- choose an owning organization (a user account can be bound to one or multiple organizations);
- choose at least one license from the proposed.

You can use any available schemas in order to create shareable JSON objects.

=== Select a schema

=== Edit object definition

image:object-json-edition.png[EditionJsonObject]

The form above is generated thanks to the JSON schema.
Using this form ensures that you will create valid objects.

If you update the schema related to an already defined object, eventual validation errors will be displayed in the gray box at the right of the interface.


=== Exporting an object for use in MONARC

Objects exported from MOSP can be imported in your projects via the
link:https://www.monarc.lu/documentation/user-guide/#management-of-knowledge-base[knowledge base] of MONARC.

MONARC will be able to handle the CSV or the JSON export.




== Using the API

APIs are provided in order to interact with the service programmatically.

The section xref:api-v2.adoc#API v2[API v2] describes the API v2.

The xref:api-v1.adoc#API v1[API v1] is still available but is really discouraged
to be used.



== Permissions

This section details the management of permissions in MOSP.

=== Schemas

You can only create an object in one of the organizations your account is
linked to.

In order to edit a schema your account must be linked to the owning
organization of the schema.


=== Objects

You can only create an object in one of the organizations your account is linked to.
Since all schemas are public you can instantiate a new object with the schema of your choice.

In order to edit an object your account should be linked to the owning
organization of this object.



== Schemas external references

If there are external references between the schemas available in your MOSP
instance, the relations will be analyzed by MOSP in order to link objects.

Theses links are considered during the edition of objects (<<Edit object definition>>).
